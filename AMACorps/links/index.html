      <h1>CU CS AMA Helpful Links</h1>
      
      <p>
	Here is a list of helpful websites a resources around the Interwebs!
	Check them out for a wide range of CS hints, tips, tricks, and help.
	For more information on the CU CS AMA Corps, see our
	<a href="/AMACorps/">homepage</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Help Forums</h2>

      <p>
	These websites are good places to ask for help, or to view
	answers to other people's questions. Take some time to learn
	the etiquette on each site before posting a new question. In
	general, it's always best to search through the site for your
	answer before posting a new question. Asking questions that have
	already been answered (and that a quick search would have revealed)
	is frowned upon.
