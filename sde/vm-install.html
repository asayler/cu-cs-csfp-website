      <h1>Installing the VM</h1>
            
      <p>
	The CU CS Virtual Machine image is designed to run
	with <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle
	VirtualBox</a>. VirtualBox can be used on Windows, Linux, or
	OSX (Apple) systems. The VM itself
	runs <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 12.04
	GNU/Linux</a>. These directions will take you through the
	process of setting up the CU CS VM on your machine.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	If you would like in-person help installing the VM, please
	contact your instructor, TA,
	or <a href="mailto:andrew.sayler@colorado.edu">CSFP
	Personnel</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Before continuing, you should confirm that your system meets
	the <a href="./vm-reqs.html">system requirements</a> before
	proceeding. You should also
	have <a href="./vm-obtain.html">obtained a copy</a> of the VM
	image.
      </p>


      <h2>Install VirtualBox</h2>

      <p>
	To start, download and install VirtualBox on your
	computer. The method for doing this varies depending on your
	computer's operating system:
      </p>

	  </a>
	</em>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>
	  If you are using Windows, download the
	  "<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox
	  for Windows hosts</a>" installer, and run the resulting .exe
	  file to install VirtualBox on your system.
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you are using OSX, download the
	  "<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox
	  for OS X hosts</a>" installer, and run the resulting .dmg
	  file to install VirtualBox on your system.
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you are using Linux, you can likely obtain VirtualBox via
	  your system package manager. See
	  "<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads">VirtualBox
	  for Linux hosts</a>" for more information.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Import the VM Image</h2>

      <p>
	Once VirtualBox has been installed, and you have downloaded
	the .ova VM image file, you are ready to load the VM image
	onto your machine.
      </p>

	    Importing the CU CS VM Image into Oracle VirtualBox
	  </a>
	</em>
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  Start by running VirtualBox
	</li>
	<li>
	  Once VirutalBox has started, select "File&gt;Import
	  Appliance" from the main menu. This will launch the
	  "Appliance Import Wizard"
	</li>
	<li>
	  Click the "Choose..." button on the first page of the wizard
	  and select the .ova VM image file you downloaded
	  previously. Click "Next" to advance to the second page of
	  the import wizard.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The second page of the wizard will display the default
	  VM settings. You may leave these settings as they are (if in
	  doubt, do this), or you may adjust them to better suite your
	  machine. If you wish to adjust them, pay particular
	  attention to the CPU and RAM settings. Generally, these
	  should be set to either half of your system total, or 2
	  CPUs (cores) and 2048 MB RAM, whichever is lower. When
	  complete, click "Import" to complete the Wizard.
	</li>
	<li>
	  You will now be presented with a progress bar that reads
	  "Importing Appliance..." It may take 5 to 10 minutes for the
	  import to complete.
	</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Run the VM</h2>

      <p>
	  Once the import has completed, you are ready to run the
	  VM. You will repeat this process each time you wish to use
	  the
	  VM.
      </p>

	    Booting and Using the CU CS Virtual Machine
	  </a>
	  </em>
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  Select the VM in the main VirtualBox window, and click the
	  green "Start" arrow near the top of the screen. This will
	  launch the VM in a new window.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The VM will boot much like a regular computer
	  does. Depending on your system, you may be presented with
	  several VirutalBox dialog boxes during the boot
	  process. These are generally informational and may be
	  dismissed once read. (You may wish to check the "Do not show
	  again" option to avoid dealing with these dialogs each time
	  your boot the VM.)
	</li>
	<li>
	  Once booted, you should be presented with the Ubuntu 12.04
	  desktop inside the VM window. The desktop should
	  automatically re-size itself to fit the VM window. If it
	  does not, you may wish to try clicking and dragging the
	  corner of the VM window to change its size. Often, you
	  must re-size the VM window once or twice to before the
	  desktop auto-resizing will begin to work.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The first time you boot the VM, you will be presented with
	  the "Dropbox Setup" wizard on the Ubuntu
	  desktop. <a href="http://db.tt/3QPOD94"
	  target="_blank">Dropbox</a> is an easy way to get files on
	  and off your VM, as well as to provide you with a
	  cloud-based backup of your files. If you wish to use
	  Dropbox, follow the wizard to complete the setup
	  process. <strong>Using Dropbox is strongly encouraged to
	  ensure you always have a cloud-based backup of your VM
	  work.</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
	  At this point, your VM is ready to use. The most commonly
	  needed programs are all available via shortcuts on the
	  left-hand sidebar. Play around a bit to familiarize yourself
	  with Ubuntu.
	</li>
	<li>
	  When you are done using your VM, shut it down in the same
	  manor you would a physical machine. In Ubuntu, this involves
	  clicking the small "gear" icon in the upper right corner of
	  the screen. Once the VM shutdown, the VM window will
	  automatically close.
	</li>
      </ol>
