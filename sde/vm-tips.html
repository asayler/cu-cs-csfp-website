      <h1>Getting the Most Out of the VM</h1>
      
      <p>
	To ensure that your VM experience is as good as possible,
	please consider the tips, tricks, and recommendations contained
	on this page.
      </p>

      <h2>Default Credentials</h2>
      
      <p>
	Normally, you don't need a password when using the VM. But
	sometimes you may be required to enter the user password to
	complete certain tasks. The default user name and password for
	the VM are listed below. Feel free to change these on your
	copy of the VM if you desire.
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>User: user</li>
	<li>PW: user</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Backing Up Your Data</h2>
      
      <p>
	The VM, while fairly reliable, does tend to be more prone to
	failure and data loss then a physical computer due to the
	nature of VMs in general. Thus, it is important to ensure
	that you have backups of all personal data stored on the
	VM. There are a variety of methods for backing up data from
	the VM, several of which are listed below.
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <strong>Dropbox:</strong> <a href="http://db.tt/3QPOD94"
	  target="_blank">Dropbox</a> is installed on the VM by
	  default. If you set up a Dropbox account (or link the VM to
	  an existing Dropbox account), any files you store in the
	  '~/Dropbox/' directory will be automatically synced to the
	  cloud. As long as you store all of your personal files in
	  your Dropbox directory, using Dropbox can provide both a
	  backup for your data on the VM as well as a means for
	  transferring data on and off the VM.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Github:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/"
	  target="_blank">Github</a> is a cloud-hosted Git
	  repository. It is free to use and offers a simple way to
	  backup and sync your code to the cloud (with all of the
	  benefits of the <a href="http://git-scm.com/"
	  target="_blank">Git SCM</a>). If you place your code in Git
	  repositories on the VM and then sync these repositories to
	  your Github account, you can ensure that you always have a
	  backup copy of your code off the VM.
	</li>
      </ul>
