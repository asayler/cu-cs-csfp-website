      <h3>VirtualBox 64-bit VT-x/AMD-V "Not Operational" Error</h3>

      <p>
	If you are using a computer on which the processor
	virtualization extensions (VT-x/AMD-V) have been disabled by
	default (or if you have manually disabled them), you will
	receive the <a href="./img/VirtualBox_VT-x_Error.png"
	target="_blank">following error message</a> when booting any
	64-bit VM:
      </p>

      <p>
	<em>
	  VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has been enabled, but is
	  not operational. Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a
	  64-bit CPU and will not be able to boot.
	</em>
      </p>
      <p>
	<em>
	  Please ensure that you have enabled VT-x/AMD-V properly in
	  the BIOS of your host computer.
	</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The solution to this problem is to reboot your host computer,
	enter the BIOS/System setup screen before your host OS starts,
	and enable processor virtualization support. The exact process
	to do this differs by computer model, but the general process
	for a PC is listed below. In general, Mac/OSX user will not
	encounter this issue.
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li>Reboot the host computer</li>
	<li>
	  As soon as the host computer begins to boot (before the
	  host OS starts) look for a message on the screen telling which
	  button to push to enter Setup (often it's F1, F2, Enter, Esc,
	  or F8). Push this button quickly to launch the BIOS setup
	  menu.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Find the virtualization settings in the setup menus. Often
	  they are located with the <a href="./img/BIOS_Security.jpg"
	  target="_blank">"Security" settings</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Change all virtualization settings (especially the VT-x or
	  "Virtualization" setting) from
	  "<a href="./img/BIOS_Security_Virtualization_Disabled.jpg"
	  target="_blank">Disabled</a>"
	  <a href="./img/BIOS_Security_Virtualization_Enable.jpg"
	  target="_blank">to</a>
	  "<a href="./img/BIOS_Security_Virtualization_Enabled.jpg"
	  target="_blank">Enabled</a>".
	</li>
	<li><a href="./img/BIOS_Save+Exit.jpg" target="_blank">Save
	  your BIOS settings</a> and exit/reboot</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
	If you can not enable virtualization, if you processor does not
	support virtualization, or if you are using a 32-bit processor
	or a 32-bit OS you may need to fall back to using the 32-bit
	VM image. Please contact your instructor or
	<a href="mailto:andrew.sayler@colorado.edu">CSFP personnel</a>
	for more information.
