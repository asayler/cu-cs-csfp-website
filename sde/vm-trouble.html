      <h3>VirtualBox 64-bit VT-x/AMD-V "Not Operational" Error</h3>

      <p>
	If you are using a computer on which the processor
	virtualization extensions (VT-x/AMD-V) have been disabled by
	default (or if you have manually disabled them), you will
	receive the following error message when booting any 64-bit
	VM:
      </p>

      <p>
	<em>
	  VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has been enabled, but is
	  not operational. Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a
	  64-bit CPU and will not be able to boot.
	</em>
      </p>
      <p>
	<em>
	  Please ensure that you have enabled VT-x/AMD-V properly in
	  the BIOS of your host computer.
	</em>
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
	The solution to this problem is to reboot your host computer,
	enter the BIOS/System setup screen before your host OS starts,
	and enable processor virtualization support. The exact process
	to do this differs by computer model, but the general process
	for a PC is listed below. In general, Mac/OSX user will not
	encounter this issue.
