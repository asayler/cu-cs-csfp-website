      <h1>CU CS Standard Development Environment</h1>
      
      <p>
	As part of the <a href="/">CU CS Foundation Program</a>, the
	department develops and supports the use of a standard
	development environment (SDE) for all CS courses. The goal of
	this environment is to provide all CS students with the tools
	they need to complete their CS courses and to prepare students
	for CS development work in the real world.
      </p>

      <h2>CU CS Virtual Machine</h2>

      <p>
	The simplest method for getting up and running with the SDE is
	to use the CU CS Virtual Machines. A Virtual Machine is a
	simulated "computer" that runs as a program on your real
	computer.
      </p>

      <p>
	Instructions for downloading and installing the CU CS VM can
	be found at
	<a href="https://foundation.cs.colorado.edu/vm/">https://foundation.cs.colorado.edu/vm/</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>CU CS Apt Packages</h2>
      
      <p>
	Students wishing to set up native Linux systems running the CU
	SDE (i.e. not use the VM) may do so by using the packages
	hosted in the <a href="http://apt.cs.colorado.edu"
	target="_blank">CU CS Apt repository</a>. Each CU core course
	(and many of the optional courses) have associated Apt
	packages that will automatically install all required software
	for the course in a single, simple, step.
      </p>

      <p>
	Currently, we provide packages for
	<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop"
	   target="_blank">Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)</a>.
	These packages may also work with other versions of Ubuntu
	or other Linux distributions supporting the apt/deb package
	format, but YMMV.
      </p>

      <p>
	To use and install the CU CS Apt packages, follow the directions at
	<a href="http://apt.cs.colorado.edu"
	target="_blank">apt.cs.colorado.edu</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>CU CS Education Laboratory (CSEL)</h2>
      
      <p>
	The <a href="https://csel.cs.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">
	  Computer Science Education Laboratory (CSEL)</a> is a CU
	Linux lab that runs a copy of the CU CS SDE. The lab
	consists of both physical machines that students can use in
	person, as well as remote serves that students may SSH into
	to do work. The CSEL is available for use by any student
	enrolled in at least one CU CS course.
      </p>

      <p>
	More information on the CSEL is available at
	<a href="https://csel.cs.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">
