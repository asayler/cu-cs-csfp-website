      <h1>CU CS Standard Development Environment</h1>
      
      <p>
	As part of the <a href="/">CU CS Foundation Program</a>, the
	department develops and supports the use of a standard
	development environment (SDE) for all CS courses. The goal of
	this environment is to provide all CS students with the tools
	they need to complete their CS courses and to prepare students
	for CS development work in the real world.
      </p>

      <p>
	The standard development environment is provided in several
	flavors. Students are encouraged to use whichever flavor they
	feel best fits their preferences and requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>CU CS Virtual Machine</h2>

      <p>
	The simplest method for getting up and running with the SDE
	is to use the CU CS Virtual Machines. A Virtual Machine is a
	simulated "computer" that runs as a program on your real
	computer. The CU CS VM comes pre-installed with a copy of the
	SDE and is ready to use out of the box.
