      <h1>CU CS Standard Development Environment</h1>
      
      <p>
	As part of the <a href="/">CU CS Foundation Program</a>, the
	department develops and supports the use of a standard
	development environment (SDE) for all CS courses. The goal of
	this environment is to provide all CS students with the tools
	they need to complete their CS courses and to prepare students
	for CS development work in the real world.
      </p>

      <p>
	The standard development environment is provided in several
	flavors. Students are encouraged to use whichever flavor they
	feel best fits their preferences and requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Help</h2>

      <p>
	If you require extra help with the VM or other component of
	the SDE, stop by any of the <a href="/AMACorps">CSEL AMA
	office hours</a>
	or <a href="mailto:andrew.sayler@colorado.edu">andrew.sayler@colorado.edu</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>CU CS Virtual Machine</h2>

      <p>
	The simplest method for getting up and running with the SDE is
	to use the CU CS Virtual Machines. A Virtual Machine is a
	simulated "computer" that runs as a program on your real
	computer.  The CU CS VM comes pre-installed with a copy of the
	SDE and is ready to use out of the box for the following
	courses:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>CSCI 1300</li>
	<li>CSCI 2270</li>
	<li>CSCI 2400</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	The CU CS VM can also be used with a number of upper level CS
	courses. Simply setup the VM via the steps below, and then
	install the <a href="http://apt.cs.colorado.edu"
	target="_blank">required package</a> for your specific course
	by opening a terminal on the VM and running:
      </p>
      <p>
	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install &lt;course package&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
	To setup your copy of the VM, follow the steps below:
      </p>

	<li><a href="./vm-obtain.html">Obtaining the VM Image</a></li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Spring 2014 VM Install Sessions</h3>

      <p>
	If you would like some in-person help getting your copy of the
	CU CS VM setup, please attend one of the following install
	sessions. All install sessions are held in
	the <strong><a href="https://csel.cs.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">CSEL
	Student Lab</a> (ECCS 112)</strong>. We will provide USB flash
	drives with copies of the VM image for your convenience.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<em>
	  All Spring 2014 VM install sessions have passed. If you
	  require extra VM help, please attend
	  an <a href="/AMACorps">AMA help session</a>.
	</em>

      <h2>CU CS Apt Packages</h2>
      
      <p>
	Students wishing to set up native Linux systems running the CU
	SDE (i.e. not use the VM) may do so by using the packages
	hosted in the <a href="http://apt.cs.colorado.edu"
	target="_blank">CU CS Apt repository</a>. Each CU core course
	(and many of the optional courses) have associated Apt
	packages that will automatically install all required software
	for the course in a single, simple, step.
      </p>

      <p>
	Currently, we provide packages for
	<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop"
	   target="_blank">Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin)</a>.
	These packages may also work with other versions of Ubuntu
	or other Linux distributions supporting the apt/deb package
	format, but YMMV.
      </p>

      <p>
	To use and install the CU CS Apt packages, follow the directions at
	<a href="http://apt.cs.colorado.edu"
	target="_blank">apt.cs.colorado.edu</a>.

      <!-- <h3>Fall 2013 Dual Boot Install Sessions</h3> -->

      <!-- <p> -->
      <!-- 	Sometimes, it makes more since to have a native copy of Ubuntu -->
      <!-- 	as opposed to using the VM. If you would like some help -->
      <!-- 	getting Ubuntu installed on your machine, either as a -->
      <!-- 	dual-boot option along side Windows or as a stand alone OS, -->
      <!-- 	please attend one of the following install sessions. -->
      <!-- </p> -->
      
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!-- 	Setting up a dual boot install is inherently more risky that -->
      <!-- 	using the VM. As such, we recommend the following prerequisites -->
      <!-- 	to any dual boot install: -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <!-- <ul> -->
      <!-- 	<li>Have at least 30GB of free HD space (and more is better)</li> -->
      <!-- 	<li>Back up all your data to an external HD/cloud/etc</li> -->
      <!-- 	<li>Have access to a copy of the install media for Windows and any other programs you use</li> -->
      <!-- 	<li>Be willing to wipe reinstall Windows should something go awry</li> -->
      <!-- </ul> -->

      <!-- <p> -->
      <!-- 	All install sessions are held in -->
      <!-- 	the <strong><a href="https://csel.cs.colorado.edu/" -->
