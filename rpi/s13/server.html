      <h1>The Raspberry Pi as a Server</h1>

      <p>
	This page contains instructions for setting up your Raspberry
	Pi as a web server in the context of the <a href="/rpi/">CU
	CSFP RPi Project</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

      <p>
	We will be starting with the the Raspbain OS configured as we
	left it at the end of the <a href="./setup.html">first
	session</a>. If you are using your own RPi or SD Card, you may
	download
	a <a href="/files/2013-04-21_cu-csfp-rpi-raspbian.zip">fresh
	version</a>
	(<a href="/files/2013-04-21_cu-csfp-rpi-raspbian.zip.sha1">sha1</a>)
	of this configuration and flash it via
	the <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup"
	target="_blank">normal means</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	We will also be using <a href="https://www.github.com"
	target="_blank">GitHub</a> to distribute and save code for
	this project. Students are encouraged to sign up for a free
	GitHub account if they do not already have one.
      </p>

      <h2>Network Setup</h2>

      <p>
	Before we can use our RPi as a server, we need to give it a
	permanent location on our network. Normally, when you
	connected your Pi to a network, it uses the Dynamic Host
	Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to automatically obtain an IP
	address and related network information. This address may
	change every time we reboot the Pi or reconnect to the
	network. A server, however, must have a constant IP address so
	that we can always connect to it on the network.
      </p>

      <p>
	Before we start reconfiguring the network, it's best to shut
	down our network connection. This will minimize the likelihood
	of conflicts between the new and old configuration. You can
	shutdown the network connection (assuming your are using a USB
	wifi adapter) by running the following command:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
	  sudo ifdown wlan0
      </code></pre>

      <p>
	To setup a static IP, we'll use the traditional file-based
	Linux network configuration systems. On Debian-derived Linux
	distributions, the network settings are set via the
	'/etc/network/interfaces'. Open this file as root ('sudo') in
	a text editor of your choice (emacs, vim, etc) and make the
	following changes (we assume you are using the USB wifi
	adapter to connect to the network and that it is currently
	connected):
      </p>

      <pre><code>
	  auto lo
	  iface lo inet loopback
	  
	  auto eth0
	  iface eth0 inet dhcp
	
	  auto wlan0
	  allow-hotplug wlan0	
	  iface wlan0 inet static
	      wpa-ssid YOUR_WLAN_SSID
              wpa-psk  YOUR_WLAN_PASSWORD
              address  YOUR_STATIC_IP
              netmask  YOUR_NETWORK_MASK
              gateway  YOUR_GATEWAY
              dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

	  #iface wlan0 inet manual
	  #    wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
	  #iface default inet dhcp
      </code></pre>

      <p>
	You will also likely need to update your '/etc/resolv.conf'
	file if you wish to properly resolve DNS queries:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
	  nameserver 8.8.8.8
	  nameserver 8.8.4.4
      </code></pre>

      <p>
	Finally, we can bring the network back up (if this command
	generates errors or does not work, confirm that the
	configuration is correct and/or try restarting your Pi):
      </p>

      <pre>
	<code>
	  sudo ifup wlan0
	</code>
      </pre>

      <h2>Apache HTTP Server</h2>

      <p>
	The <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache
	HTTP Server</a> is one of the most popular HTTP servers on the
	Internet. You can use Apache to serve static web pages, dynamic
	web applications, files, and much more.
      </p>

      <h3>Install Apache</h3>
      
      <p>
	We will start by installing Apache on our Raspberry Pi. Apache
	is included as a package in the standard Debian package
	repositories, so we can install it
	using <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get"
	target="_blank">apt-get</a>. The following commands will
	install Apache on the Pi:
      </p>
      
      <pre><code>
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install apache2
      </code></pre>
