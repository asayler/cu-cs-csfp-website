      <h1>Session 1</h1>

      <p>
	<em>
	  This page is part of the <a href="/arduino">CU CSFP
	    Arduino Project</a>.

      </p>

      <p>
	In this session we will be building a small "Smoke Detector"
	appliance. We will program the Arduino to detect smoke and
	sound an alarm. We will also explore adding to this
	functionally with things like rest/test buttons, LEDs, heat
	sensors, etc. Although we will not go that far, the pcDuino
	could be sued to enhance our Smoke Detector to build an Internet
	connect "Smart" smoke detector similar to
	the <a href="https://nest.com/smoke-co-alarm/life-with-nest-protect/"
	target="_blank">Nest Protect</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	<em>Note: Although we will be building a basic "smoke
	detector", our smoke detector should not be used in any
	life-critical application (i.e. as a replacement for a REAL
	smoke detector). Commercial smoke detectors go through a
	variety of safety certifications and have been carefully
	designed to ensure that they will function correctly in a
	range of circumstance and that they will help save your life
	in the event of a fire. Our device should not be mistaken for
	or used as a life-saving device. It is not one.</em>
