      <h1>CU CS Foundation Topics</h1>
      
      <p>
	As part of the <a href="/">CU CS Foundation Support
	Program</a>, we hold regular lectures on material not covered
	in the standard CS courses. This material often provides
	information on the tools used in the CS program, CS topics
	outside the scope of the standard CS curriculum, or things we
	just happen to find interesting. Most lectures are
	recorded. This page provides the current lecture schedule, as
	well as links to the videos for previous lectures.
      </p>

      <h2>Spring 2013 Lectures</h2>

      <p>
	Lecture are open to all CU CS students, faculty, and staff. In
	situations where lecture fill up, priority will be given to CS
	undergraduate students. All skill levels are encouraged to
	attend. Some lectures constitute a mini-series, where attending
	or viewing previous lectures in the series may be a
	prerequisite to attending future lectures in the series.
