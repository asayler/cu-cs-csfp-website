      <h1>CU CS AMA Volunteering</h1>
      
      <p>
	Interested in becoming an AMA volunteer?
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li><strong>Do you like helping your fellow CS
	    students?</strong>
	<li><strong>Are you looking for teaching and leadership
	    experience?</strong>
	<li><strong>Want to help foster a sense of community within
	    the CS Department?</strong>
      </ul>

      <p>
	The Department of Computer Science runs a program to provide
	general assistance to students taking CS courses via regular
	staffed "office" hours in the CSEL. We are always recruiting
	for new volunteers to join the <a href="../">AMA ("Ask Me
	Anything") Corps</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>

      <p>
	Potential volunteers should generally be <strong>Juniors or
	Seniors</strong> who have completed the following CS courses
	(or equivalents):
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>CSCI 1300 (Intro to Programming)
	<li>CSCI 2270 (Data Structures)
	<li>CSCI 2400 (Computer Systems)
      </ul>
      
      <p>
	Potential volunteers should be comfortable answering questions
	about the aforementioned courses, as well as talking about
	their general CS experiences, other CS interests, and any
	other CS knowledge they may have (Linux, web
	development, etc). Candidates should also be able to
	spare <strong>about two hours per week</strong> during a
	regularly scheduled time to make themselves available in the
	CSEL.
      </p>

      <h2>Apply</h2>

      <p>
	Interested candidates should contact Andy Sayler
	(<a href="mailto:andrew.sayler@colorado.edu?Subject=AMA%20Volunteer%20Application">andrew.sayler@colorado.edu</a>)
	expressing their interest and briefly outlining their
	credentials. We will then follow up with applicants via
	e-mail.
